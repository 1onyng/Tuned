Tuned allows users to see what sound looks like by generating animations for the different range of frequencies from either a specific song or microphone input.  

## MVP

Users will be able to:
* Play their own songs
* Play a sample track
* View frequency spectrum visualization for a specific song
* Genereate their own waveforms via microphone
* Toggle between different animations

## Architecture and Technologies

Tuned is implemented with the following technologies:
* JavaScript for rendering & animation logic
* Canvas to create 2d drawings 
* Web Audio API to extract data from audio content
