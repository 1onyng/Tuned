# Tuned

Tuned allows users to see what music looks like by generating animations for the different range of frequencies from a specific song.  

## MVP

Users will be able to:
* Play their own songs
* Play a sample
* Adjust the color/style of the visualization
* See a detailed report of the frequency spectrum and its amplitude

## Architecture and Technologies

Tuned is implemented with the following technologies:
* JavaScript for rendering & animation logic
* Canvas to create 2d drawings 
* Web Audio API to extract data from audio content

## Implementation Timeline

* Day 1
  * Research Web Audio API & review canvas lecture/readings.
